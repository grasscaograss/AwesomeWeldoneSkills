# Verification Before Completion

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status:
1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim
```

## Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:** Run command → See output → State result WITH evidence
**Build:** Run build → See exit 0 → State "Build passes"
**Requirements:** Re-read plan → Checklist → Verify each → Report gaps

**No shortcuts. Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.**
